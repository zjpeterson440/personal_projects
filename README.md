The NFL project came about during a football game last year when overhearing an announcer talk about how good a QB is in the cold. I wanted to see if there were any stand out QBs in cold/hot weather or if temperature made a neglegable difference on QB performance. Contains the following: 
* `Python`
* `Excel`

SQL Medical Data uses a generated SQL database using a star schema. The Excel file was provided and then imported into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for analysis. Questions range in difficulty. More will be added over time. Contains the following:
* `SQL (SSMS)`

Cyclistic Case Study is the Google Data Analytics capstone analysis.  The full report can be seen [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zachpeterson/cyclistic-case-study-with-excel-python-tableau) on Kaggle. Further analysis will be done in SQL (SSMS) and Excel (Pivot Tables/Pivot Charts) and be put in the project folder when completed. Contains the following:
* `Python`
* `Excel`
* `SQL (SSMS)`


I really like to cook but finding recipes can be a pain. This project scrapes popular websites and will put recipe information in a database. That database will then be connected to some form of user interface. Here the user will be able to filter based on ingredients, star ratings, nutrition info ect.
The end result of the project will be something that provides cursorary information and a link to the website's recipe.
* `Python`
* `SQL (SSMS)`
* `Azure DB`
